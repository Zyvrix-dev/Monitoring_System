# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The Monitoring System project is currently in active development. The `main`
branch receives security updates on a best-effort basis. Stable release tags,
when published, will receive fixes for critical vulnerabilities as resources
allow.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do **not** open a public issue.
Instead, contact the maintainers directly at
[security@monitoringsystem.example](mailto:security@monitoringsystem.example)
with the following details:

- A description of the vulnerability and the potential impact
- Steps to reproduce the issue or proof of concept code, if available
- Any suggested mitigations or fixes

We aim to acknowledge receipt of security reports within **5 business days** and
provide an initial assessment or remediation plan within **15 business days**.

## Preferred Languages

Please submit reports in English if possible.

## Public Disclosure

We will work with you to coordinate disclosure. Do not publicly disclose the
vulnerability until a fix has been released and you have received permission to
share details.
